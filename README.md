# XD Toolkit
A program for working with the charge density refinement software XD.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Warning!
--------
This is the first major software project I ever worked on. There are many questionable design decisions, and a distinct lack of linting and unit testing.

**Potential employers**: Please do not take this as a good example of my current coding ability.

**Potential users**: Please be aware that this software is not stable and may lead to incorrect results.

**Potential developers**: If you want to turn this software into a stable application, feel free to get in touch and we can discuss.

Installation
------------

Windows:

1) Go to the releases page and download the latest Windows setup file.
2) Run the setup, and follow the instructions.

Linux:

1) Download ZIP and extract, or clone repository.
2) Go to a command prompt, navigate to the src folder and enter: $ python XDToolkit.py
   Alternatively, open XDToolkit.py in an IDE and run it from there.
