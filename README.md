# XD Toolkit
A program for automating XD X-ray diffraction charge density refinement workflows
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Warning
--------
This is the first major software project I ever worked on. It's purely here for historical interest. Use/read at your own risk.

Installation
------------

Windows:

1) Go to the releases page and download the latest Windows setup file.

   Alternatively, open XDToolkit.py in an IDE and run it from there.
