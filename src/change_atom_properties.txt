# Edit this file to change atomic color and/or covalent radii for XDPlotter.
# All lines starting with '#' are treated as comments.
#
# Colors: Section start with 'start_color' and ends with 'end_color'. 
# One line per entry specifying first the atomic symbol as a string: e.g. Fe
# equal to (=) color as an HEX code (e.g. ff0000 for red)
# DO NOT USE '#' or ''s!
# Fe = ff0000
#
# Radii: Section start with 'start_radius' and ends with 'end_radius'.
# One line per entry specifying first the atomic symbol as a string: e.g. Fe
# equal to (=) covalent radius as a float (in Aa), e.g. 1.25:
# Fe = 1.25
#
# No empty lines between start and end statements!
